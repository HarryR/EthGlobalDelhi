 * @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167[ERC-1167] is a standard for

 *
 * > To simply and cheaply clone contract functionality in an immutable way, this standard specifies
 * > a minimal bytecode implementation that delegates all calls to a known, fixed address.
 *
 * The library includes functions to deploy a proxy using either `create` (traditional deployment) or `create2`
 * (salted deterministic deployment). It also includes functions to predict the addresses of clones deployed using the
 * deterministic method.

     * to always have enough balance for new deployments. Consider exposing this function under a payable method.
